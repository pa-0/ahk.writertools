This holds templates and Macros aimed to help writers. All templates work with Microsoft Word but can be freely adapted, as you so wish. Just link to [my website](http://blindjournalist.wordpress.com/) when crediting me. Look in [the Wiki](https://github.com/rkingett/writertools/wiki) for a tutorial and documentation.
